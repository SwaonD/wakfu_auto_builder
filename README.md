# AUTO-BUILDER prototype

This builder use math to mazimize dammage or tankyness based on some initial carac constraints.

This is the POC code from that Wakfu [forum post](https://www.wakfu.com/fr/forum/8-discussions-generales/429089-prototype-builder-presentation-concept)

If you are interested please leave an issue/comment/like whatever. We will create an open Source project later on
